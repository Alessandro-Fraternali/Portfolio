I took my first steps by creating components for portals on ForumFree, ForumCommunity, and occasionally even on MySpace. \n In 2020, I made a significant decision: to enroll in the Boolean Careers course, promising to train Full Stack Web Developers from scratch.\n\nSince then, my passion for coding has transformed into a structured training path. During the course, I gained in-depth skills and later chose to specialize in the frontend, completing additional courses, including two focused on SEO. Since 2021, I've had the opportunity to work in teams on Angular projects, which I consider my forte to date.\n\nThis ongoing growth journey is fueled by curiosity and the desire to learn more in the vast universe of web development. I am continuing to take dedicated courses. The creation of this portfolio also stems from my desire to put into practice what I have learned over the years. The transition from team to individual work has allowed me to delve into parts of Angular usually handled by other colleagues."

Recently, I found in ChatGPT an excellent study companion, capable of advising me on how to approach different situations and at the same time creating exercises to improve my skills.\n\nThroughout my journey, I adopted a simple statement from one of my Boolean instructors on the first day, 'Always keep learning.' Just two words, but I immediately marked them in my notebook and still carry them with me, a constant reminder to keep the desire to learn and grow professionally alive."
